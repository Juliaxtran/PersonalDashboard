# PersonalDashboard

I created a  personal dashboard extension! This extension was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrates with four different APIs to provide a beautiful and functional dashboard every time you open a new tab.

The extension includes the following features:

* A stunning background image from Unsplash
* Up-to-date information on cryptocurrency prices from a crypto API
* Inspiring quotes to start your day off right from a quotes API
* Current weather conditions for your location from a weather API

To use the extension 
* download code
* go to chrome [go to chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/)
* turn on developer mode
* press load unpacked and upload the code
* Open the tab and enjoy!
